### Project Title
BIKESHARE ANALYSIS

### Description
This project creates an interactive shell program to display different stats about bike sharing
in New York, Chicago and Washington

### Files used
Three csv files with data on the three cities are needed for the program to run.
This is in addition to the `bikeshare.py` python file included in this repository.

### Credits
Special thanks to the exceptionally detailed pandas [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).
They provide methods that enable the quick execution of methods required to run the program.
